7.75E+17	"The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!"	
7.75E+17	Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!	
7.75E+17	"RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country."	
7.75E+17	"While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!"	
7.75E+17	"Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!"	
7.75E+17	"Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!"

7.74E+17	Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.	
7.74E+17	.@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

7.65E+17	Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!	
7.65E+17	"Stay on message is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!"	
7.65E+17	I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!	
7.65E+17	"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"	
7.65E+17	"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!"	
7.65E+17	Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!	
7.65E+17	My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.	
7.65E+17	"If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%"	
7.65E+17	"The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said"	
7.65E+17	The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

7.65E+17	@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain Thanks	
7.65E+17	I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!	
7.65E+17	The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

7.58E+17	"Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!"	
7.58E+17	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!	
7.58E+17	Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!	
7.58E+17	The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!	
7.58E+17	"Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!"

7.58E+17	"Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time."	
7.58E+17	"Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!"	
7.58E+17	Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.	
7.58E+17	"If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself."

7.58E+17	"Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!"	
7.58E+17	"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie."

7.58E+17	Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!	
7.58E+17	"How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!"	
7.58E+17	"The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me"	
7.57E+17	Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!	
7.57E+17	"The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!"	
7.57E+17	"The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!"	
7.57E+17	The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!	
7.57E+17	"Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!"	
7.57E+17	"Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out"	
7.57E+17	"If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild"	
7.57E+17	"The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!"	
7.57E+17	"I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!"	
7.57E+17	"Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)"	
7.57E+17	"Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!"	
7.57E+17	"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"	
7.57E+17	An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.	
7.57E+17	"Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!"	
7.57E+17	"Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!"	
7.57E+17	"Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT"	
7.57E+17	The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

7.57E+17	Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!	
7.57E+17	Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.	
7.57E+17	"Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED"	
7.57E+17	"Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!"	
7.57E+17	"Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!"	
7.57E+17	"The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?"	
7.57E+17	@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain	
7.57E+17	I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.	
7.57E+17	Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

7.56E+17	STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH https://t.co/uzBOm21Pug	
7.56E+17	The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.	
7.56E+17	Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!	
7.56E+17	"In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!"	
7.56E+17	Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

7.53E+17	"If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!"	
7.53E+17	Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?	
7.53E+17	Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!	
7.53E+17	On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.	
7.53E+17	Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.	
7.53E+17	Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!	
7.53E+17	Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. https://t.co/teoVCYXKOR	
7.53E+17	Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!	
7.53E+17	The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!

7.53E+17	Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.	
7.53E+17	Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.	
7.53E+17	#CrookedHillary is not qualified! https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O	
7.53E+17	I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

7.52E+17	President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

7.51E+17	"Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C."	
7.51E+17	Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.	
7.51E+17	"Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City"	
7.51E+17	"I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies."	
7.51E+17	"Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!"

7.51E+17	Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!	
7.51E+17	"I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8, she's out!"

7.50E+17	It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!	
7.50E+17	Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!	
7.50E+17	"On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. ""Special: Meet the Trumps"" Hope you enjoy!"	
7.50E+17	Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?	
7.50E+17	"With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!"

7.50E+17	"In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!"	
7.50E+17	I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!	
7.50E+17	"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away, no pictures."""	
7.50E+17	"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"	
7.50E+17	THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!	
7.50E+17	"On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!"	
7.50E+17	Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!	
7.50E+17	Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.	
7.50E+17	"Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!"	
7.49E+17	"It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!"	
7.49E+17	It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
